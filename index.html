      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p class="bio">I am a third year student who is currently pursuing B.Tech in Electronics and Computer engineering at Vellore Institute of Technology, Chennai.<br><br>
        The field of <em>Web development and design</em> help me best utilise my keen attention to detail and my drive towards perfectionism.
        It also gives me the chance to express my creativity through creating beautiful and seamless web pages.</p>

      <h2>My Skills.</h2>
      <div class="skill-row">
        <img class="computer" src="images/computer.png" alt="">
        <h3>Design & Development.</h3>
        <p>I have a strong passion for creating effective design. For me, effective design is not just a website that looks pretty but a website that will communicate my client's needs and visions. I possess the ability to listen to the client's needs and design a web-page that will reflect their brand's values. I am constantly hunting for design inspirations on Pinterest and figuring out how to code those designs! </p>
      </div>
      <div class="skill-row">
        <img class="drawing" src="images/drawing.png" alt="">
        <h3>Creative vision.</h3>
        <p>I have always been drawing and doodling designs and I believe that I am the best person to bring those designs to life by being a front-end web developer. I believe that I have the ability to come up with original ideas which are not only beautiful but convey the meaning behind them.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="skill-row">
        <img class="version" src="images/version.png" alt="">
        <h3>Version control: Git & GitHub.</h3>
        <p>As a front-end developer, I tend to make quite a few changes to my websites as I am always looking to make every element on my page better. Tracking these changes to my code can get quite tricky so that is why I decided to learn Version Control and I am well-versed in Git and GitHub.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="skill-row">
        <img class="ui-ux" src="images/ui-ux.png" alt="">
        <h3>UI-UX design skills.</h3>
        <p>I am in the process of honing my UI-UX design skills which would enable me to make a product both, effective and aesthetically pleasing. Well-versed in typography, color palettes, spacing, imagery and responsive designs. I believe that UI & UX go hand in hand and as a web developer, I can best represent the needs of my client.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="skill-row">
        <img class="time" src="images/time.png" alt="">
        <h3>Good time management skills.</h3>
        <p>Among the many skills that I possess, I believe that I am also well-organised and that helps me stay on top of my work. Time management is key when it comes to developing a website for a client. According to me, it is important to be able to set deadlines and stick to them. Although I am a bit of a multi-tasker, I believe that focusing on one task at hand can produce better results.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="skill-row">
        <img class="problem-solving" src="images/problem-solving.png" alt="">
        <h3>Problem-solving skills.</h3>
        <p>I believe that I have good problem-solving skills. I am good at identifying the issues, coming up with effective solutions and then implementing them. I enjoy the feeling of fixing bugs in my code as it gives me a sense of accomplishment.</p>
